## Instructions

To run the file, simply run ```main.py``` and select a sort of your choice. The button of selected sort will turn green and disable the other sorts until the selected sort is finished. As the sort is in progress, there is a time elapsing to indicate how long it takes to sort 150 elementts based on the sort selected. 

## Colors 

For comparison of elements in the list, the line will change color to Red, while swapping the elements will turn Blue. 

For merge sort specifically, on final merge, every element line will turn orange.
